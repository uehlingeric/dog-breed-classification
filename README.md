## Technical Implementation Details

### Transfer Learning
- Freezing convolutional base layers to retain learned feature extraction capabilities
- Replacing classification layers with custom heads tailored to the 70 dog breeds
- Selectively unfreezing later layers during training to fine-tune high-level feature representations
- Using different model architectures (ResNet50, EfficientNet B0, DenseNet121) to capture diverse feature patterns

### Ensemble Method

- Assigns architecture-specific weights based on validation performance on per-class basis
- Implements a weighted voting system that accounts for model confidence
- Balances strengths of different architectures (ResNet's depth, EfficientNet's efficiency, DenseNet's feature reuse)

### Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)
- Generating 5 variations of each test image (original plus 4 augmented versions)
- Creating versions with horizontal flips, slight rotations, and brightness adjustments
- Averaging predictions across all variations to reduce sensitivity to image orientation
- Demonstrating dramatic improvement for difficult classes (40% gain for Scotch Terrier)

### Data Augmentation
- RandomResizedCrop: Handles size variations while maintaining content integrity
- RandomHorizontalFlip: Improves generalization for orientation-invariant features
- RandomRotation: Builds resilience to different angles and positioning
- ColorJitter: Creates robustness to variations in lighting and color balance
